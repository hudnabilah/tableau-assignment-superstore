## ✅ Business Recommendations

[cite_start]Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided[cite: 97, 100, 103, 105]:

| Recommendation | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prioritize High-Profit Products** | [cite_start]Focus marketing and inventory efforts on top-performing items like Copiers, Printers, and select Office Tech[cite: 98]. [cite_start]Expand these product lines regionally[cite: 99]. |
| **Investigate Unprofitable High-Sellers** | [cite_start]Products like **Tables** are unprofitable despite selling well[cite: 101]. [cite_start]Consider renegotiating supplier costs, raising prices, or phasing out low-margin items (SKUs)[cite: 102]. |
| **Boost South Region Strategy** | [cite_start]Address the repeated profit losses in the South region with a localized strategy focusing on operational efficiency, cost control, or tailored marketing[cite: 104]. |
| **Leverage Seasonal Peaks** | [cite_start]Since Q4 shows a spike, plan major promotions, restocking, and campaigns ahead of the September to December window[cite: 106]. |

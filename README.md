## ✅ Business Recommendations

[cite_start]Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided[cite: 97, 100, 103, 105]:

| Recommendation | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prioritize High-Profit Products** | Focus marketing and inventory efforts on top-performing items like Copiers, Printers, and select Office Tech. Expand these product lines regionally. |
| **Investigate Unprofitable High-Sellers** | Products like **Tables** are unprofitable despite selling well[cite: 101]. [cite_start]Consider renegotiating supplier costs, raising prices, or phasing out low-margin items (SKUs). |
| **Boost South Region Strategy** | Address the repeated profit losses in the South region with a localized strategy focusing on operational efficiency, cost control, or tailored marketing. |
| **Leverage Seasonal Peaks** | Since Q4 shows a spike, plan major promotions, restocking, and campaigns ahead of the September to December window. |
